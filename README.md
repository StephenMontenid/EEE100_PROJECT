# Coder Monks’ Stopwatch #

Hello and welcome :wave: This is our group, “CODER MONKS,” and we created a Stopwatch.

## A digital stopwatch :watch: is utilized to record the length of time of an event. It is a type of clock that is notable for the precision with which it can ensure the accuracy of an event. A basic stopwatch should have the following buttons: start, stop, split (lap), and reset. ##

# Stopwatch Basic Functions #

*Start Button*: to begin running the counting of time.

*Stop Button*: to abruptly stop the counting of time.

*Split (Lap) Button*: indicates the interval between the counting of time.

*Reset Button*: restoring it back to its default zero settings.

# What's New? #
We have improved and added some unique features for our stopwatch.

For more information, just check our 2-minute video about our stopwatch through the link attached below.

It Allows the user to save the recorded lap times and is able to save them as a file.
### How to save  a Lap file? ###
1.	The user should save the source code in a folder, then proceed to the stopwatch. 

2.	Enter a chosen file name, then run the stopwatch and press the save button in the right side of the ‘file name’.

3.	To view the recorded file, just go to the folder where the source code of the stopwatch can be found.

Allows the user to continue running the stopwatch that has been paused or stopped.

It offers unlimited lap times, so the user can press the lap button as many times as they want. It also has a list box with a scroll bar to store the recorded lap times, so the user can view the recorded laps up and down.

Make it easier to access and to know the time and date while using it.

# Hotkeys :keyboard: #

The developers enable the main functions of the stopwatch to be executed by pressing certain keys.

See the attached video link above for the demonstration of Hotkeys.

# Virtual mouse :computer_mouse: #

Employs the mouse to move through the entire screen and executes the left click button by using image recognition and hand-tracking. Moreover, the developers integrate this virtual mouse system for scenarios where the user is relatively far from the device, i.e., the user can use the stopwatch program without using hotkeys or an external mouse to manually operate the stopwatch. 

To access the virtual mouse please download all the files in this repository and make sure that the directory are followed just like in the image below.

Now, open the "STOPWATCH" folder first in the VS code or any IDE of your choice, then followed by the "Virtual mouse" folder. Make sure two tabs are open. See reference image.

The developers designed the stopwatch to be minimalistic and simple with an Aegean blue matte color and white accents. To be specific, the developers employ images to create icons for each button to make them more stylish and modern. 

# The Developers #
While designing and implementing this project as an amateur, we encountered a number of errors and difficulties. However, it can be used and developed in the near future as we continue to practice and engage in programming. We learned many things and will continue learning from this. Again, we are the coder monks, signing off! See you soon on the next project!
